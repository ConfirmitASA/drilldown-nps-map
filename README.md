## Maps Constructor

[Maps Constructor](https://confirmitasa.github.io/drilldown-nps-map/constructor) is a utility script that makes setting up a Highcharts drilldown map easier by providing a map list with countrycodes necessary for configuring the DBTableDesigner table geo hierarchy.


## DrilldownMap

This class helps setting up the drilldown map based on the TableDesigner table data as well as an aggregated table. The map drills down by dynamically loading content without page refresh
It has support for custom regions that consist of several countries as well as displaying mappoints. All elements support conditional formatting with variable target per region and a relative formatting function.
Tooltips display all information that's in the initial table.
